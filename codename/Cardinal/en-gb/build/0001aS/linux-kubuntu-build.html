            <div><h4>Introduction</h4></div>
            <div>These release notes for Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu) provide an overview of the release and document the known issues with Ubuntu and its flavours.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div><h4>Support lifespan</h4></div>
            <div>Ubuntu 22.10 will be supported for 9 months until July 2023. If you need Long Term Support, it is recommended you use <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JammyJellyfish/ReleaseNotes/">Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</a> instead.</div>
        </div>
        <div><h3>New features in 22.10</h3></div>
        <div><h4>Updated Packages</h4></div>
        <div><h4>Linux kernel</h4></div>
        <div>Ubuntu 22.10 is shipped with the new 5.19 Linux kernel that brings the following (most relevant) features (in addition to many other new features, new drivers, improvements and fixes):

            - The new futex_waitv() syscall that can speed up games by letting them wait for multiple futexes with a single system call.
            - Support in the task scheduler for CPU clusters that share L2/L3 cache (spreading tasks between clusters will bring more memory bandwidth and decrease cache contention).
            - Support for Intel® AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions) instructions.
            - CO-RE support that makes compiled BPF programs more portable.
            - A faster random number generator (entropy extractor switched from SHA1 to BLAKE2s).
            - Support for proactive reclaim in memory control groups.
            - Support for Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (TDX).
        </div>
        <div><h4>systemd v251.4</h4></div>
        <div>The init system was updated to systemd v251.4. Please refer to the upstream <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases/tag/v251">changelog</a> for more information about individual features.</div>
        <div>
            <h3>Toolchain Upgrades</h3>
        </div>
        <div><h4>debuginfod support</h4></div>
        <div>Following the recent <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2022-September/001320.html">announcement</a> of our <a href="https://debuginfod.ubuntu.com/">debuginfod instance</a>, Ubuntu now automatically requests debug symbols from the service when GDB (or any other debuginfo-consuming application) is used. Please refer to the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/service-debuginfod/30534/10">Ubuntu Server Guide on debuginfod</a> for more information.</div>
        <div><h4>Security Improvements</h4></div>
        <div>
            - AppArmor gained support for restricting access to unprivileged user namespaces. This allows a system administrator to configure their system so that only applications and services which are confined by an appropriate AppArmor profile can use this feature.
        </div>
        <div><h4>Base System</h4></div>
        <div><a href="https://github.com/canonical/netplan/releases/tag/0.105">Netplan v0.105</a> gained support for VXLAN, VRF and InfiniBand devices</div>
