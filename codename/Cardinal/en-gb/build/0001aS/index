        <div>
            <div><h4>Support lifespan</h4></div>
            <div>Ubuntu 22.10 will be supported for 9 months until July 2023. If you need Long Term Support, it is recommended you use <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JammyJellyfish/ReleaseNotes/">Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</a> instead.</div>

        <div><h3>New features in 22.10</h3></div>
        <div><h4>Updated Packages</h4></div>
        <div><h4>Linux kernel</h4></div>
        <div>Ubuntu 22.10 is shipped with the new 5.19 Linux kernel that brings the following (most relevant) features (in addition to many other new features, new drivers, improvements and fixes):

            - The new futex_waitv() syscall that can speed up games by letting them wait for multiple futexes with a single system call.
            - Support in the task scheduler for CPU clusters that share L2/L3 cache (spreading tasks between clusters will bring more memory bandwidth and decrease cache contention).
            - Support for Intel® AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions) instructions.
            - CO-RE support that makes compiled BPF programs more portable.
            - A faster random number generator (entropy extractor switched from SHA1 to BLAKE2s).
            - Support for proactive reclaim in memory control groups.
            - Support for Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (TDX).
